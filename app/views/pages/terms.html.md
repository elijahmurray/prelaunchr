#### **Making a Referral**

An individual must register for the Program to make a referral; no purchase is required. Once an individual refers a friend, family member or colleague, he/she becomes a Referrer and will be provided with a unique promotional code ("Personal Promotional Code") that allows the Referrer to receive credit for Qualified Referrals ("Credit"). Personal Promotional Codes will be issued only to individuals. Each Referrer will also be provided with a unique and personal Company "Refer-a-Friend" page or account to view the status of his/her Qualified Referrals and manage his/her account.

#### **Qualified Referrals**

A Qualified Referral means that all the following conditions are met:

1. The Referred Customer completed the purchase process with the Service using the Referrer's Personal Promotional Code.

3. The Referred Customer is a) a legal resident of the United States and b) at least 18 years old; and

4. The Referred Customer does not cancel the order and is shipped a kit from the Company.

Only one Qualified Referral can be earned for each Referred Customer during the Program term. Any additional or subsequent purchases made by a Referred Customer will not be Qualified Referrals.
